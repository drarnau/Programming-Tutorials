    "## Goal of this tutorial\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to present the features of the European labor market in Python consistently and with commentary. From a programming side, the main objective was working with data. From an economic side, the main objective was implementing an economic model and using programming to demonstrate features otherwise more difficult to demonstrate. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will focus mainly on the learnings from a programming perspective. However, this introduction will set up the background from an economic side to orientate the reader. There will be additional economic commentary throughout the sections.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## A simple model of the labor market\n",
    "A simple model of the labor market that is used in this tutorial catagorizes three states a working-age person can be in:\n",
    "1.   Employed *E*\n",
    "2.   Unemployed *U*\n",
    "3.   Inactive or out of the labor force *N*\n",
    "\n",
    "Using three states you can analysze labor market indicators:\n",
    "* **Participation Rate**:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{E+U}{E+U+N}\\end{equation}\n",
    "* **Employment Rate**:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{E}{E+U+N}\\end{equation}\n",
    "* **Unemployment Rate**:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\frac{U}{E+U}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The flows of people from one state to another are called **transitions**.\n",
    "Transition rates are calculated from using data that shows the beginning and end value of people in states, and then is calculated from the change. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, *UE transition rates* represent the percentage of people unemployed at the beginning of the period that transition to being employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be used to approximate how likely it is for an unemployed person to find a job (Job finding probablity).\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be elaborated upon further in the tutorial as it specific to certain sections."

    "# Data\n",
    "<a id=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "## Eurostat Data\n",
    "In order to compare the different dynamics of countries related to transition rates and unemployment rates, data needs to be collected systematically and in a reliable manner. All data used in this tutorial is extracted from Eurostat which is an adminitrative branch of the European Commission located in Luxembourg. Its responsability is to provide statistical information to the institutions of the European Union and to encourage the harmonisation of statistical methods in order to ease comparison between data. In this section, we will discuss how Eurostat gather data and the degree of relability of its operations. Eurostat publishes its statistical database online for free on its [website](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that will interest us in this tutorial are the one related to the European Labor market. \n",
    "**The European Labor Force Survey** is a survey conducted by Eurostat in order to find those data. The latter are obtained by interviewing a large sample of individuals directly. This data collection takes place over on a monthly, quarterly and annually basis. \n",
    "The European Labor Force Survey collects data by 4 manners: \n",
    "- Personal visits\n",
    "- Telephone interviews\n",
    "- Web interviews\n",
    "- Self-administered questionnaires (questionnaire that has been designed specifically to be completed by a respondent without intervention of the researchers)\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall accuracy of these methods have been proved to be high. Retrospectively, the results have been found to lay in a 95% confidence interval. For more information related to how Eurostat collects its data, you can consult this [page](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/FR/tipsun10_esms.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data for this tutorial\n",
    "In Eurostat, you are able to download a .tsv file. Tsv files are similar to csv but use tabs to separate data instead of commas like in csv files. \n",
    "Or, you can use the Pyrostat API for python. However, the documentation at the moment of creating this tutorial is not clear enough to present in a clear way. It is based upon a json and unicode REST api from the eurostat page, but is beyond the scope of this tutorial. For more information see [eurostat web services](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/json-and-unicode-web-services) and  [pyrostat](https://github.com/eurostat/pyrostat).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for this tutorial comes from the Eurostat website. In particular, the data set (sdg_08_30) with information [here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/sdg_08_30_esmsip2.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the rest of the tutorial will focus on data import, cleaning and analysis starting with the provided Excel files from this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data in Python: Pandas and Data Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will give a basic introduction into how data works in python and programming. \n",
    "Data in general can be stored in several different formats that organize it. The basic formats have been introduced in past tutorials (lists, dictionaries, tuples). More advanced ones are:\n",
    "1.  Unstructured data files of .txt.\n",
    "2.  Or structured data files:\n",
    "    * CSV files such as excel that separate data cells with a comma and creates tables.\n",
    "    * TSV files that separate data cells with tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be imported into python and stored in a *data frame* using the python extension pandas. \n",
    "The advantage of data frames is the wide variety of operations you can perform on them in python since it is a python object ([source](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-introduction-to-the-pandas-python-library-f1b678f34673)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a pandas dataframe is structed by rows and column, it is easier to select data compared to a list or a dictionary. You can also easily filter by column or row in order to derive conclusions or structure the data set for analysis. You can also join different pandas datasets as well as clean data easier than if you were working with another data type. These examples are elaborated upon below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up your pandas enviorment\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often easy to import *pandas* as *pd* such so it easier to call it later on. \n",
    "```\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Additonally, it is common to also import it with the package *numpy*\n",
    "```\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "Numpy is used for analysis and computing in python. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Reading data into a dataframe\n",
    "In order to convert structured files into a pandas data frame there are a variety of options that you can find here: [List of pandas functionalities](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#input-output).\n",
    "Some examples are the ability to convert excel, json, html, csv, pickle, and sql. \n",
    "These are generally formatted as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "read_excel\n",
    "read_pickle\n",
    "read_json\n",
    "read_html\n",
    "etc. \n",
    "```\n",
    "### Creating a dataframe manually\n",
    "There is also the option with pandas to create a dataframe either manually or by using existing lists or dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, dataframes can be created from dictionaries. "

    "The easiest way to handle our data is a [`pandas.DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html). Fortunately, Pandas as a useful function to read Excel files and create DataFrames out of them: [`pandas.read_excel`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_excel.html) \n",

    "1. Rows at the beginning of the spreadsheet that don't contain the data we're looking for and that we'd therefore like to skip when reading the Excel into a DataFrame\n",
    "2. The shape of the Excel file is not in the way that would be conventional for [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/). The index (the time period) is usually in the rows instead of the columns.\n",
    "3. Eurostat records missing data with \":\" and a separate sheet for flags, while *NaN* is the proper way to record missing observations. This means we'll have to set all the missing observations to *NaN*\n",
    "4. Some Country names, for example \"Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG)\" are in a format that makes it hard to use them in loops and other functionalities of python.\n",
    "5. To work efficiently with `pandas` classes, it is important to use the right [indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html). In this case we are dealing with (a set of) [time series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html), so we want the index to have the proper functionality. In particular, our data refers to a full calendar year quarter which can be represented using a [period](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html#periodindex-and-period-range). This sort of information cannot be read from the Excel file as the reference to the quarters there is just a string.\n",

    "Another type of data useful to provide us with insight concerning the European Labor Market is the transitions rates. They tell us how fast or how likely an individual move from a category to another. There are 9 different transitions formed by the 3 states a person can be in : 'U' for unemployed, 'E' for employed, and 'N' for out of the labor force. Therefore we can explicit all the different transitions from a period to another (t to t+1) by a matrix 3x3:\n",

    "Nevertheless, it is important to mention that we calculate transition rates and not exactly the probabilitiy to move from 1 state to another because of the following reasons. The way data is collected tells us how many people move across states **for a given period** and with those data we can compute the transitions rates. For example the UE transition rate tell us the proportion of unemployed people that went from unemployment to employment at the end of a given period. To calculate it, we divide the number of people that from 1 state to another by the number of people in the initial state and we have our rate that we can call *rate_UE* for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many transitions can happen at any time between the person is surveyed the 1st time and the second. The current data only measure the transition from point a to point b but not what happens inbetween. Since Eurostat do not register data in continuous but in a discret manner and changes happen in continuous, the transition rates are only an approximative of the probability to move from 1 state to another. Plus, since those rates should approximate probabilities, they can not be negative or greater than 1.\n",

In order to do the later, we can define a function that uses `DataFrame.min()` and `DataFrame.max()`. The function warns us if a value in the rows or column of the Dataframe is smaller than 0 or bigger than 1 since they represent probabilities. . max().max() will look at the maximum of the rows and maximum of the columns and similarily for min().min(). We don't have to check every single value because if the maximum and minimum values fulfill this criterium, the rest of the values will be okay, if not, we have to check the whole code anyway."
