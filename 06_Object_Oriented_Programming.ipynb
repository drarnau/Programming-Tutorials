    "Programming languages are often classified by the programming paradigm they mainly support. The features of each programming language often encourage, or even mandate, structuring the various parts of a program in a specific way. While Python is often referred to as an object-oriented language, it is probably best described as a multi-paradigm programming language as its features also many other programming paradigms. A paradigm can be described as a specific approach to solve a problem through programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the various paradigms is the way they handle the state of the program, i.e. the values of its variables. Controlling how and where state is transformed in a program has practical implications for how reliable and manageable the code becomes. Each programming pradigm offers a different way of managing state, in the hope that the program does not quickly fall into the trap of \"spaghetti code\", where the code is so badly structured that it becomes too complex to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, three programming paradigms are: \n",
    "1. [Procedural](###Procedural)\n",
    "2. [Functional](#functional_comparison)\n",
    "3. [Object-Oriented](#oop_comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following subsections will illustrate the differences between these three programming paradigms by producing the same output using code organised in these three different ways."

    "In the following sub-chapters, the three different paradigms - procedural, functional and object oriented - will all be illustrated by the same example: the construction of the Model X car by the manufacturer Tesla. The aim of this chapter is to convey to the reader that the three paradigms are not completely different 'things', but rather allow a different perspective or approach to tackle one and the same problem. The example with the car, a simple everyday objcet, is used to convey the concepts of the three paradigms more easily. To get a better idea of the car, here is a picture of the original Model X by Tesla:\n",

In this specific example of building a car, we will first create a constrcution plan that will later be expandend by attributes and functionalities in oder to derive at the final fully functioning car. To create the construction plan, we need something with which we can link the different attributes and functions of the car.
