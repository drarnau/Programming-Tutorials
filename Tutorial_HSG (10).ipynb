    "We use conditionals all the time in our daily lives without even realizing it. However, they aren't written in Python. We use conditionals in choices ranging from deciding what to wear in the morning to life-changing decisions like selecting a job.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would cross the street if the light turns green; otherwise, I would wait. If the sun comes up, I would get out of bed; otherwise, I would go back to sleep again. Okay, it's not quite that simple, but when we make decisions based on circumstances, our brain behaves similarly to a machine: it evaluates the conditions and acts on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditions - usually in the form of `if statements` - are one of the key features of a programming language, and Python is no exception. `If statements` are control flow statements which allow us to run a particular code and make a decision only when a certain condition is met. Most of the time, this decision depends on the value of variables or arithmetic expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements represent the set of instructions that allow us to make these decisions and perform computations depending on whether the code (a specific Boolean constraint) evaluates to `True or False`. Therefore, in a programming language, there are often two parts to a sample of code: One which will be executed, if the condition is `True`, and another one, if it is `False`. In the upcoming chapter, you will get to experiement with conditionals with an extedend example!\n",

    "## Additional Material: Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting looking at `if and else statements`, we will dive deeper into the basic operators that we will use in the next examples. The `if`, `if-else` or `elif` statements, that we will see, will contain these operators. Here is a short list of operators that we have included in our programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Assignment operators`: `=` (assign)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Comparison operators`: `==`  (equal), `!=` (not equal)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Logical operators`: `and` (Returns True if both statements are true), `or` (Returns `True` if one or both of the statements are true)\n",
    "\n",
    "It must be added that, in Python, `==` and `=` do not have the same meaning. `=` assigns a value to a variable, for example `age=5` implies that the value 5 is assigned to `age`. In contrast, `==` is the equal sign, that we commonoly use in mathematics. The latter symbol is used to check whether two expressions give the same value. For instance, (x==y) would result in `False` if we had assigned different values to x and y.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If and else statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we put ourselves in the shoes of a college applicant, who is looking to submit both his essay and grade transcript to his college of choice. The university's application portal verifies whether the application is successful by asking the applicant to type in `Completed` if the applicant wrote his essay and `Sent` if he sent his grades.\n",
    "The indented block will only be executed (the application will only be successful) if the words `Completed` and `Sent` are typed in. If the user enters any other set of words, nothing happens. Please remember to add quotation marks (\" \") to the instructions that you want the applicant to see, as the text represents a string (a sequence of characters) and not including the quotation marks would give you a Syntax error."

    "`Do-while loops` are a variant of the basic `while loops`. Although, they do not exist in Python themselves, we can write a Python program that functions like a `do-while loop`. As stated previously, in a `while loop` the condition is checked before running the loop. Hence, with a basic `while loop`, if the condition is not met, then the body of the loop is not executed. To avoid such a situation, with a `do-while loop` the computer will first execute the body of the loop and then check whether the condition is fulfilled. As long as the condition holds, the loop will keep running. Once the condition is not fulfilled anymore, the next statement is executed.  A `do-while loop` can be quite useful when one wants to initialize a program and make the loop run at least once."
