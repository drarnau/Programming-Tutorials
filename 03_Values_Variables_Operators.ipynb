        "Any programming language is based on data and in Python data is realised as objects. A data type denotes a set of \"similar\" values. Data types define the possible values of variables, attributes (and methods). Generally, the data stored can be of many types, however Python provides various standard data types. The data type is determined by assigning a value to a variable. Hence, a value can be defined as a piece of data or information. It is useful to use these built-in data types since it facilitates the programme-writing process. The main data types or types of values are the following: \n",
        "- Text Type:\t`str` (strings)\n",
        "- Numeric Types:\t`int` (integer numbers), `float` (floating point numbers), `complex` (complex numbers)\n",
        "- Sequence Types:\t`list` (lists), `tuple` (tuples)\n",
        "- Mapping Type:\t`dict` (dictionaries)\n",
        "- Boolean Type:\t`bool` (booleans)\n",
        "\n",
        "When operating with these data types, a particular Python language syntax is used to create an object. In this sense, it is important to mention that the operations performed on the value are bound by the type. Hence, when using strings, one can only use string operators or when operating with a list, list operations should be used. Python can detect the type of value, which is especially useful if the value of a variable is changed. In this case Python automatically adapts the new variable type."

To create a dictionary, the key: value pairs are separated by commas and enclosed in curly brackets `{}`.
